# BCA Programming Repo

Welcome to my BCA Programming repository! Here, you'll find a collection of assignments, projects, and tasks related to my BCA program.

## Structure

- 📁 **Assignments**: Contains individual assignments provided by the teachers.
- 📁 **Projects**: Includes any larger projects or practical tasks assigned in the course.
- 📁 **Tasks**: Additional coding tasks, challenges, or exercises given by the instructors.

## Purpose

This repository serves as an organized archive of my academic journey, showcasing my progress in programming.

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made.
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
8. Do not be lazy. Never be lazy. If there is a bug find the root cause and fix it. No temporary fixes. You are a senior developer. Never be lazy.
9. Make all fixes and code changes as simple as humanly possible. They should only impact necessary code relevant to the task and nothing else. It should impact as little code as possible. Your goal is to not introduce any bugs. It’s all about simplicity.
